# Key Exchange Example
An example of using Diffie-Helman algorithm and AES (symetric encryption).
Key exchange is possible by connecting two peers with PeerJS library and PeerJS Server.
Build using TypeScript and Webpack.
## How to run?
I recommend using LiveServer in VSCode, then type localhost: 5500 in your browser, generate a pair of keys and you're done!

Enter public key of your friend in receiver id, press connect button, and if the reciver also preformed this action, you have established an encrypted connection.
